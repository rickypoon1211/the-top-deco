            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <p>Mr. Chan Kwok Wa founded the company in 2009, starting from a small business and growing it to become a major contractor for multiple chain stores, dedicated by his relentless efforts. Before 2009, the company operated as a sole proprietorship and officially transitioned into a limited company that same year. One of our long-term clients is The Dairy Farm Company Ltd., and we have worked together for over 20 years.</p>
            <p>During this period, we have also collaborated with numerous groups of varying sizes, aiding their growth and development, from small operations to public listings. These achievements stem from Mr. Chan's over 40 years of rich experience. He has utilized his expertise to help various companies successfully transform, expand, and go public. Our company remains committed to fulfilling customer needs at the lowest possible cost.</p>
